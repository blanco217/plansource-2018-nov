### Task 1 - Bowling Kata  

Branch:  
* task_1_bowling_kata

Lessons:
* Shameless Green
* Introduction to bowling scoring

Time: 
* 30 minutes

Instructor:  
* Describe the task (basically, say what's in tasks.md)  
* Make sure they can run the tests


----
----
### Task 2 - No-tap and Duckpin

Branch:
* task_2_support_notap_duckpin

Lessons:
* Open/closed, isolating the things that vary, DRY
* Practice refactoring

Time: 
* 2 30-minute blocks ?

Instructor:
* First, just do No-tap.
    * Is shameless green open to No-tap?
    * What do you need to vary? What smells? How to dry it out?
* Once they get No-tap working
    * ask them to do duckpin 
    * watch them be really happy that they can just add a config.


----

### Task 4a - Lowball via config change and factory complexity

Branch:
* task_4_implement_lowball

Lessons:
* More of what worked might not be better
* Understand the tension between designing
    * one common, shareable but very abstract solution, vs
    * defining single abstract 'role' and dividing the code into multiple concrete role players.

Time: 
* 30 minutes

Instructor:
* Encourage them to try to solve this problem by creating a LOWBALL config, and extending it/changing the factory in whatever ways are required to support LOWBALL.

They do:
* write code

Instructor after:
* What keys did you add to the config?
* What changes did you make in the factory code?


----
----
### Task 4b - Learn to draw sequence and class diagrams

After they finish (or fail to finish) hacking the config/factory

Lessons:
* Design is about the image in your head, not the characters you type

Instructor:

* Have them study the sequence diagram tutorials listed in references.txt
* We explain class diagrams (TODO we draw one?, be prepared!)

### Task 4c - Lowball via extract parser

Lessons:
* Conditionals, no matter how well hidden, tell us to create objects
* Sometimes you have to stop and think
* Spikes can help you think if you don't understand the problem well enough to do TDD

Time: 
* I wish I knew


Instructor:
* They probably made the config much more general (by passing in an operation and some lambda's to evaluate in the factory).
    * point out that these things are just hidden conditionals, i.e.
        * if the config is 'a', do thing 'a1'
        * if the config if 'b', do thing 'b1', 
        * etc.
    * Conditionals mean we're missing objects.  
    * What objects are missing?
    * Make them figure out what varies, which is ...
        * the rules for figuring out what kind of frame the incoming rolls represent, and
        * the value to be added to the score for each pinfall
    


They do:
* draw sequence/class diagrams of their proposed LOWBALL design
* write code to
    * extract the thing that varies (StandardRollParser)
    * inject it so that they can depend on an abstract role (Parser)
    * create another player of the role (LowballRollParser)
        * Do they TDD this, or spike it via integration tests (the refactor branch commit at this point has intergrations tests, with ponderings about TDD)
    * inject LowballRollParser when they're playing LOWBALL


----

### Task - Magic Tricks Talk 

Time: 
* 30 minutes

Lessons:
* How/When to test the 6 kinds of messages
    * Incoming command/query
    * Private command/query
    * Outgoing commnd/query

Instructor:
* Walk through the Magic Tricks talk here.


----
----
### Task 5 - Unit tests

Branch:  
* task_5_update_tests

Lessons:
* Practice writing loosly coupled unit tests

Time: 
* 60 minutes

They do:
* Update the unit tests
* Browse bowling_5_unit_tests_refactor and be prepared to discuss
    * The StandardRollParserTest uses a made up config.  Ask them why?  What purpose does this serve?
    * The Variant test uses a fake parser (TestParserWhichAlwaysReturnsTwoRollsOfOnePin).  Why?  Again, what purpose?



*Day 1 probably ends before they complete Task 5.  Continue it on Day 2*

### Task 7 - Finish Interactive Game

Branch:  
* task_7_finish_interactive_game

Lessons:
* Layered Architectures
* More practice with sequence/class diagrams

Time: 
* All Morning?  
* Perhaps into Lunch?

Instructor:  
* We should re-read the tasks.md in the branch before talking to them

They do:
* Get oriented by studYing the existing code (this task branch starts a few commits into the bowling_7_interactive_play_refactor, after the initial annoying puts/chomps have been written.)
* Draw class and sequence diagrams for the code as it exists at the start of the task

Once they understand the starting place, they do:
* Discuss possible interactive game designs
* Draw class and sequence diagrams for their designs
* Maybe ? write some code
* Prepare to present their design to the class, illustrated by their class and sequence diagrams

### Task 7a - Interactive Game Design Presentations and Discussion

Teams take turns presenting their interactive game designs, respsonding to questions from the audience.


----
----
### Task 7b - Critique my Interactive Game implimentation

They do:
* checkout branch bowling_7_interactive_play_refactor  
* draw sequence/class diagrams
* class discussion to critique the code


----
----
### Task 8 - Use classic scoresheet

Branch:  
* task_8_use_classic_scoresheet

Lessons:
* Adapter pattern
* Test doubles: stubs, mocks, fakes

Instructor:  
* Remind them about the adaptor pattern
* Suggest that they write a Scoresheet API test
* Ask them to consider which scoresheet should be used in the tests
* Should they define a FakeScoresheet for the tests? If they create a Fake, how will they ensure that the 3 players of the scoresheet role (DetailedScoresheet, ClassicScoresheet, FakeScoresheet) remain in sync?
* What if they wanted to Mock the scoresheet in the tests?  How hard/easy is this, given the current implementation (Game has a demeter violation, i.e. scoresheet_maker.new().render).

They do:
* Adapt ClassicScoresheet such that it can be used by Game (i.e. such that it responds to #render)
* Change Game to be able to use either scoresheet
* Decide how to test the Game/Scoresheet interaction. 
    * Game tests using a real scoresheet
    * Game tests by stubbing #render in a real scoresheet
    * Game tests using a fake scoresheet (whose API they guarantee)
    * Game tests using a mock

### Task 9 - Isolate Frame Status

Branch:  
* task_9_isolate_frame_status

Lessons:
* Separating abstract and concrete in Inheritance Hierarchies
* How correct inheritance hierachies enable composition
* Composition
* Strategy-ish pattern
* Consequences of immutability
    * Where is the logic to pick the correct status?
    * How would this be different if you allowed the rolls in a Frame to mutate?

Notes:
For fixing slightly incorrect hierachy
For teaching composition
For discussing mutation

----
----
### Task 10 - Output multiple scoresheets

Branch:  
* task_10_output_multiple_scoresheets

Lessons:
* Observer pattern
* Loosening coupling

Instructor:
* Have them write list of ways to be coupled, from most tight to most loose.  Their list should contain things like:
    * I know the name of a class and say #new -> #render
    * I get passed an object which I hold in a variable, to which I say #render
    * I hold a list which others can put themselves on, when I change, I iterate over the list and send each item a message.
    * I know a rule by which I can dynamically figure out to whom to send #render
    * I know a rule by which I can dynamically figure out to whom to send a message, which is also dynamic
    * Someone passes me a lambda (command) which I then execute (the 'call' dilemma.)


----

### Task 11 - Cheating

Branch:  
* task_11_cheat

Lessons:
* Decorator pattern
* Testing decorated objects


----
----
### Stickers !!

----
----
### All Bowl !!

Have them pair up and bowl, using a random number generator to determine each roll's pinfall. They can play the bowling variant of their choice.  The winner advances, the loser becomes a fan of the winner.  

Play until only one winner remains. They get the 'Luckiest Bowler' certificate.
