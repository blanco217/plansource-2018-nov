## Bowling Variants

1) No-tap: A strike is 9 (or 8 or 7, whatever) pins

    If you knock down 9 (or whatever) pins in one roll, that's a strike. The frame ends but you get two bonus rolls from the next frame(s).  

1) Duckpin: A frame contains 3 rolls

    If you knock down 10 pins in 1 roll, that's a strike.  The frame ends but you get two bonus rolls from the next frame(s).  
    If you knock down 10 pins in 2 rolls, that's a spare.  The frame ends but you get one bonus roll from the next frame.  
    Otherwise the frame score is the sum of the pinfall of the three rolls in the frame.  

1) Lowball:

    Lowest score wins, but

1) 5 Pin (Canadian): 

    5 pins are arranged in a 'V' pointing towards the bowler.  
    The center pin is worth 5.  
    The two adjacent pins are worth 3.  
    The end pins are worth 2.  
        So max of 15 within a frame (not counting strikes or spares).  
    A strike is all 15 pins on first roll, you get two bonus rolls as usual.
    A spare is all 15 pins in first two rolls; 1 bonus roll as usual.
